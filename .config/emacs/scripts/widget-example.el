;;; Commentary:
;; The widget document is not easy to understand. I think the
;; quick way to use widget is learning from examples. So I wrote
;; this library to help others understand and use widget quickly.
;;
;; I'm not expert at widget, so there may be something wrong in the
;; code. If you found it, please let me know.
;;

;;; Add New Page:
;; You can test you widget definition by add it as a new page to
;; widget demo. You can benefit from without write the code to
;; creating buffer and the key bindings of `widget-demo-mode'. Here is
;; a simple example to add new widget demo page:
;; 
;; (defun widget-demo-tree-test ()
;;   (widget-insert "Tree:\n")
;;   (widget-create
;;    '(tree-widget
;;      :node (push-button :format "%[%t%]\n" :tag "hello")
;;      :open t
;;      (push-button :format "%[%t%]\n" :tag "node1")
;;      (push-button :format "%[%t%]\n" :tag "node2"))))
;; (widget-demo-add-page "Tree Test" 'widget-demo-tree-test)

;;; TODO:
;; 1. Add tree-widget
;; 2. Add complex widget create by using several types of widget and
;;    using group.
;; 3. Add tutorial about defining new widget
;; 4. Add a macro for simplified page definition. For example:
;;    (widget-demo-insert
;;     "Some text here"
;;     (button :notify callback "label")
;;     "More text"
;;     (editable-field :form-id identifier))
