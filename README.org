* INSTALL
** Install git 
#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -Syu git
#+end_src
Remeber to backup your files
The Script must be run from from the base of the repo as shown below
** Running the script
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/TobyM7/Hyprland-Dotfiles.git
cd Hyprland-Dotfiles 
chmod +x Documents/install
Documents/install
#+end_src
The install script will ask if you want install my emacs and wallpaper configs 
Some keybindings will not work if don't install them
These include:
- The emacs submap group
- The change wallpaper command
- There will be no wallpaper at start up
* POST-INSTALL
To set theme, icons etc open GTK settings using the run menu (SUPER+O)
You may wish to use waybar as a bar instead of gBar but waybar had a broken dependancy a while back and now I have switched, but, my configs are still there.

To run:
#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -S waybar 
#+end_src  
Then you will have to edit the Hyprland config to start waybar at start up. This is in the top few lines you may also want to change the keybindings to mean that you can reload waybar instead of gBar. (A find and relpace would fix both of thes problems)

* BINDINGS
All bindings can be found in the hyprland.org file in ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.org
If you want help with bindings run keybind_help and type what you want to do
- SUPER+SHIFT+ENTER: Open terminal
- SUPER+1,...9,0:   Switch workspace
- SUPER+SHIFT+1,...9,0: Move to workspace
- SUPER+[Arrow key]: Change focus
